Deadlock prevention takes time to check for possible deadlock every time a resource is requested. When it is not possible to know how resources are being used, preventing is a good strategy to deal with deadlocks. This may be an acceptable method for desktop systems and other non-time sensitive systems.

Deadlock recovery deals with problems in case of deadlock. It is good to interrupt the proccess when it is not possible to predict the outcome, and when we know a lot of information about the processes (we know which ones to kill in order).  

Deadlock avoidance is used when we cannot use recovery and prevention (but if we can at start aviod deadlock, of course we must avoid it)
